                        Nestled on the lush and remote Isla Nublar, located 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica, Jurassic Park stands as a monument to scientific triumph. Through the groundbreaking work of InGen‚Äôs geneticists, we‚Äôve accomplished the impossible: bringing dinosaurs back to life. These aren‚Äôt animatronics. They‚Äôre not illusions. These are real, breathing, awe-inspiring giants from a forgotten age.
