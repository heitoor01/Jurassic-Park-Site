                        Nestled on the lush and remote Isla Nublar, located 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica, Jurassic Park stands as a monument to scientific triumph. Through the groundbreaking work of InGen’s geneticists, we’ve accomplished the impossible: bringing dinosaurs back to life. These aren’t animatronics. They’re not illusions. These are real, breathing, awe-inspiring giants from a forgotten age.

                        Because at Jurassic Park, we didn’t just build a theme park —
                        We revived a world.
