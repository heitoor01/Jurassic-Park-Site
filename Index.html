                <p>Welcome... to Jurassic Park.</p> <br>

                <p>The world’s first and only dinosaur theme park — a living testament to humankind’s unrelenting
                    curiosity and ambition. Here, the ancient and the futuristic collide in breathtaking harmony, giving
                    birth to an experience unlike anything the world has ever seen.</p> <br>

                <p>Nestled on the lush and remote Isla Nublar, located 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica, Jurassic
                    Park stands as a monument to scientific triumph. Through the groundbreaking work of InGen’s
                    geneticists, we’ve accomplished the impossible: bringing dinosaurs back to life. These aren’t
                    animatronics. They’re not illusions. These are real, breathing, awe-inspiring giants from a
                    forgotten age.</p> <br>

            <div class="dino-text">
                <p>🦕 Picture yourself gazing up at a gentle Brachiosaurus as it stretches its neck to nibble the
                    treetops…</p> <br>
                <p>🦖 Feel the ground tremble as a Tyrannosaurus rex lets out a roar that echoes through the jungle…</p>
                <br>
                <p>🦴 Watch in astonishment as cunning Velociraptors move in perfect coordination, revealing an
                    intelligence that challenges everything we thought we knew.</p> <br>

                <p> Jurassic Park isn’t just an attraction — it’s an expedition through time.

                    experiences, guests are not merely visitors — they’re explorers. Every detail has been meticulously
                    crafted to ensure safety, comfort, and sheer awe.</p> <br>

                <p>Because at Jurassic Park, we didn’t just build a theme park —
                    We revived a world.</p> <br>
            </div>
            <div class="science-text">
                <p>From the DNA strands extracted from prehistoric amber to the roar of a creature that hasn’t walked
                    the Earth in 65 million years, every moment here is a marvel. Whether you’re a scientist, an
                    adventurer, or a curious traveler, your journey will be filled with discovery, excitement, and
                    moments that stay with you forever.</p> <br>

                <p> So take a deep breath. Step into the land before time.
                    Because this is more than science.
                    More than fantasy.
                    This... is Jurassic Park.</p> <br>
